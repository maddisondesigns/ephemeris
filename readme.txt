The Ephemeris theme is a clean, fast and simple platform for creating beautiful, responsive custom WordPress themes. It's a simple starter theme built on HTML5 & CSS3. At its core is a fluid, responsive grid based on percentages, making for a flexible layout. It incorporates a set of common templates, support for WordPress Post Formats and the gorgeous, retina friendly Font Awesome icon font. Ephemeris is a true multi-purpose theme. With its extensive use of hooks, developers will find it a breeze to customise and extend. Ephemeris is WooCommerce compatible, Multilingual Ready (WPML), translatable, and provides RTL language support. It's also compatible with a wide range of popular page builders such as Elementor, Divi Builder, Beaver Builder, SiteOrigin Page Builder and Visual Composer. On top of that, if Elementor is your Page Builder of choice, then you also get the ability to use your own custom header and footer templates that you've created with Elementor, rather than the default theme header and footer, if you so choose. Now that's pretty cool, eh!


== Description ==

The Ephemeris theme is a clean, fast and simple platform for creating beautiful, responsive custom WordPress themes. It's a simple and elegant starter theme built on HTML5 & CSS3. At its core is a fluid, responsive grid based on percentages. This means not only is it flexible, it's extremely easy to customise.

If you do decide to use a child theme with Ephemeris, there's no need to use CSS @import or even enqueue the parent stylesheet. Ephemeris will automatically enqueue the parent stylesheet for you. Cool eh!

Ephemeris uses [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) to make sure that browsers render all elements more consistently and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) for detecting HTML5 and CSS3 browser capabilities along with some default stylings from HTML5 Boilerplate. It also incorporates the gorgeous [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icon font by Dave Gandy.

If you're looking to build an eCommerce website, Ephemeris supports the excellent WooCommerce plugin, straight out of the box.

Templates

Ephemeris includes a set of your most common theme templates, including templates for Full-Width pages, Left Sidebar, Right Sidebar (default), Front-Page, Tag, Categories, Authors, Search, Posts Archive and 404.

If you're using one of the many page builder plugins that are available, such as Elementor, Divi Builder, Beaver Builder, SiteOrigin Page Builder or Visual Composer, try using the Page Builder Full-Width Template. The Page Builder Full-Width Template is a true full browser width template. If you want a completely blank full-width page with no header or footer sections, such as for a landing page, then there is also a Page Builder Blank Template.

On top of that, if Elementor is your Page Builder of choice, then you also get the ability to use your own custom header and footer templates that you've created with Elementor, rather than the default theme header and footer, if you so choose. Now that's pretty cool, eh!

Post Formats

All the standard WordPress Post Formats are supported. These include; Aside, Gallery, Link, Image, Quote, Status, Video, Audio, Chat and of course, your standard post.

Widgets

Widgets are a great way of adding extra content to your site and Ephemeris has a whole assortment of them.

Main Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on posts and pages
Blog Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on the blog and archive pages only
Single Post Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on single posts only
Page Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on pages only
WooCommerce Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on WooCommerce pages only

The Footer Widget areas are dynamic! You can use up to four of these and they'll magically space themselves out evenly. For example, if you only add widgets into the First Footer Widget Area, then it will expand the full width of the page. However, if you add widgets to all four Footer Widget Areas, they'll magically space themselves out over four equal columns.
Footer Widget 1: Appears in the footer in column 1
Footer Widget 2: Appears in the footer in column 2
Footer Widget 3: Appears in the footer in column 3
Footer Widget 4: Appears in the footer in column 4

Custom Logo

The site logo can be easily changed using the site logo feature. You change this in Appearance > Customize > Site identity

Custom Header

The page header can be easily changed using the Custom Header feature. You change this in Appearance > Customize > Header Image

Custom Background

The background pattern can be changed using the Custom Background feature. You change this in Appearance > Customize > Background Image

Multilingual Ready (WPML)

Using the WordPress Multilingual Plugin (WPML) it's now easy to build multilingual sites. With WPML you can translate pages, posts, custom types, taxonomy, menus and even the theme's texts.

WooCommerce Support

WooCommerce is a WordPress eCommerce toolkit that helps you sell anything. Beautifully. Turn your website into a powerful eCommerce site by installing the WooCommerce plugin by WooThemes.

Developers

If you're a developer, you'll love the extensive use of hooks, making Ephemeris a breeze to customise and extend. To make this even easier, you can even view a handy visual map of all the hooks simply by defining WP_EPHEMERIS_HOOKS as true in your wp-config.php file. Doing this will cause Ephemeris to display all the theme hooks so that it's easier to work out where they are all located.

== Installation ==

There are three ways to install your theme. It can be installed by manually uploading the files to the themes folder using an FTP application, it can be installed by downloading from the WordPress Theme Directory within the Dashboard or it can be installed by uploading the theme zip file that you downloaded.

Use the following instructions to install & activate Ephemeris using your preferred method.

Manual installation:

1. Unzip the files from the Ephemeris zip file that you downloaded
2. Upload the Ephemeris folder to your /wp-content/themes/ directory
3. Click on the Appearance > Themes menu option in the WordPress Dashboard
4. Click the Activate link below the Ephemeris preview thumbnail

Install from the WordPress Theme Directory:

1. Click on the Appearance > Themes menu option in the WordPress Dashboard
2. Click the Install Themes tab at the top of the page
3. Type 'ephemeris' in the search field, without the quotes, and then click the Search button
4. Click the Install Now link below the Ephemeris preview thumbnail
5. Once the theme has been installed, click the Activate link

Install by uploading the theme zip file:

1. Click on the Appearance > Themes menu option in the WordPress Dashboard
2. Click the Install Themes tab at the top of the page
3. Click on the Upload link just below the two tabs at the top of the page
4. Click the Browse button, browse to the folder that contains the theme zip file, select it and then click the Open button
5. Click the Install Now button
6. Once the theme has been installed, click the Activate link


== Getting Started ==

Since Ephemeris is a starter theme to kick off your own awesome theme, the first thing you want to do is copy the Ephemeris theme folder
and change the name to something else. You'll then need to do a three-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for Ephemeris inside single quotations to capture the text domain.
2. Search for ephemeris_ to capture all the function names.
3. Search for Ephemeris with a space before it to replace all the occurrences of it in comments.
   (You'd replace this with the capitalized version of your theme name.)

or, to put it another way...

Search for:'ephemeris'
 Replace with:'yourawesomethemename'
Search for:ephemeris_
 Replace with:yourawesomethemename_
Search for: Ephemeris
 Replace with: YourAwesomeThemeName

Lastly, update the stylesheet header in style.css and either update or delete this readme.txt file.
